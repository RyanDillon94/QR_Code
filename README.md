- Added the QR image. 
- Got tripped up by the file paths. 
- Really struggled sizing the QR image.
- Unable to scale up to laptop.
-- Researched Media queries.
-- Created browser dimensions.
--- Deleted media queries and used ChatGPT for assistance.
--- Max-width used to maintain size when scaling up.
--- Auto height property used.
---- Re-added media query and re-jigged widths
